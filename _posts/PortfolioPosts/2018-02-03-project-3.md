## Description

This project involved recreating the design of [Gutenberg](http://gutenber.org), the first ever E-Book website , for Landing Page and Single Book page for all major screens:
* Desktop
* Tablet
* Mobile

Also for each type of screen the design must be first in Low Fidelity then Wireframes and then High Fidelity (Final look) = 18 Production Outputs. In this description, I'm going to show ***only the current version*** of [Gutenberg](http://gutenber.org) and the ***Desktop High Fidelity outputs*** made by me. Full project can be found on my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/60769689/Project-Gutenberg-ReDesign)
